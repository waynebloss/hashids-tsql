# Hashids

A small set of TSQL functions to generate YouTube-like hashes from one or many numbers. 
Use hashids when you do not want to expose your database ids to the user.

[http://www.hashids.org/](http://www.hashids.org/)

This repository contains a port to TSQL of the other projects found at hashids.org.
The Javascript and .NET versions of Hashids are the primary reference projects for this port.

The included [hashids-tsql generator](https://github.com/waynebloss/hashids-tsql/tree/master/hashids-tsql) creates a 
custom set of TSQL functions to encode values with your chosen salt and other options.

## Status

The SQL functions generated by hashids-tsql can currently encode numbers, ~~but cannot _decode_ them yet.~~ You can decode them with [this function](https://github.com/waynebloss/hashids-tsql/issues/2#issuecomment-528174001)

## Quick Start

The command below will generate a set of TSQL encode functions and test objects into the `test.sql` file.

```console
npm install -g hashids-tsql

hashids-tsql -t test.sql
```

## What is it?

hashids (Hash ID's) creates short, unique, decryptable hashes from unsigned integers.

_(NOTE: This is **NOT** a true cryptographic hash, since it is reversible.)_

It was designed for websites to use in URL shortening, tracking stuff, or 
making pages private (or at least unguessable).

This algorithm tries to satisfy the following requirements:

1. Hashes must be unique and decryptable.
2. They should be able to contain more than one integer (so you can use them in complex or clustered systems).
3. You should be able to specify minimum hash length.
4. Hashes should not contain basic English curse words (since they are meant to appear in public places - like the URL).

Instead of showing items as `1`, `2`, or `3`, you could show them as `U6dc`, `u87U`, and `HMou`.
You can choose to store these hashes in the database or encrypt + decrypt on the fly. If storing them in the database,
then hashids-tsql will let you encode hashids in a TSQL stored procedure, trigger or computed column.

All integers need to be greater than or equal to zero.

See [hashids.org](http://www.hashids.org/) for more information on this technique.

## TSQL Functions

TSQL does not have function overloading, so the single `encode` function that is common in other hashids.org libraries
is instead represented here as a set of `encode` functions with slight variations in name and declaration.

The basic forms of `encode` for TSQL are:

- `encode1(int) string`
- `encode2(int, int) string`
- `encodeList(table) string`
- `encodeSplit(string, string) string`

In TSQL, the `encode` functions that take 1 or 2 integers will be much more useful than the one that takes a table
because typically, you don't want to construct a table variable just to pass 1 or 2 integers into a function.

There are multiple variations on each basic form, in order to return different int and string types (`varchar/nvarchar,
int/bigint`). `encode1A` returns a `varchar` (ASCII) value. `encode1B` accepts a `bigint`. `encode1BA` accepts a `bigint`
and returns a `varchar` (and so on).

The SQL Server database project [HashidsTsql](https://github.com/waynebloss/hashids-tsql/tree/master/db/mssql)
in this repository contains a full set of pre-generated functions to test with.

## Use Cases

The primary use case for a TSQL hashid encoding function can be summarized in the 
[ComputedTest table](https://github.com/waynebloss/hashids-tsql/blob/master/db/mssql/dbo/Tables/ComputedTest.sql)
where the table's `HashId` uses `encode1` to hash the `Id` column as part of the atomic INSERT of a record.

However, calling `encode1` or `encode2` as part of a stored procedure might be preferable in order to avoid costly recomputes.

As a _persisted_ computed column, `HashId` [can be indexed](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189292(v=sql.100).aspx).
**BEWARE** that [some situations can result in extremely expensive queries if you add a hashid column](https://github.com/waynebloss/hashids-tsql/issues/4) so work must be done in order to avoid recomputes.

If every table were to use the same `encode1` function, then any row in any table with `Id = 1` would have the same 
hash. Therefore, `encode2` is provided, which takes 2 numbers. So, TableX can call `encode2(1, [Id])` and TableY can 
call `encode2(2, [Id])` and so on...guaranteeing that the hash for each table's [Id] column don't collide.

Two more TSQL encode functions are currently included which create a hashid from a list of numbers in a table or 
delimited string. They are `encodeList` and `encodeSplit`.

## TODO

- Find a better way to detect if a directory path is provided than by looking at the last character.
- Replace No-UTF8-BOM-in-templates.txt note with usage of something like "strip-bom" in app.js
- Create all manner of automated tests, primarily to test against other implementations.
- Create TSQL functions for decoding and integrate them into the hashids-tsql generator.
